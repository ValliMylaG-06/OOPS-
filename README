📘 Member Class – Java OOPs Project
🔷 Introduction / Theory

This project demonstrates the basic principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java. The goal is to define a simple Member class that contains two attributes: memberId and memberName. The program uses a constructor to initialize these attributes and a method to display the member's details.

It is a beginner-level Java application that helps understand how to:

Define and use classes and objects

Use constructors

Apply encapsulation by using private variables

Access data using public methods

This small Java project is ideal for learning and demonstrating class creation, object instantiation, and method calling in Java.

🎯 Aim

To define a class Member with attributes memberId and memberName, and to implement a constructor and a method to display member details using Java OOP concepts.
