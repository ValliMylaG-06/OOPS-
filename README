📘 Member Class – Java OOPs Project
🔷 Introduction / Theory

This project demonstrates the basic principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java. The goal is to define a simple Member class that contains two attributes: memberId and memberName. The program uses a constructor to initialize these attributes and a method to display the member's details.

It is a beginner-level Java application that helps understand how to:

Define and use classes and objects

Use constructors

Apply encapsulation by using private variables

Access data using public methods

This small Java project is ideal for learning and demonstrating class creation, object instantiation, and method calling in Java.

🎯 Aim

To define a class Member with attributes memberId and memberName, and to implement a constructor and a method to display member details using Java OOP concepts.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Language: Java

IDE: Eclipse (can also be run in VS Code or command line)

JDK: Java SE 21 (or compatible version)

🧠 Key Concepts Applied

Classes and Objects

Encapsulation

Constructor

Method definition and invocation

📘 Copy File Using Byte Streams – Java Project

🔷 Introduction / Theory
This project demonstrates how to copy a file using byte streams in Java. The program reads bytes from a source file (input.txt) and writes them to a destination file (output.txt) using FileInputStream and FileOutputStream.

It uses try-with-resources to automatically manage stream closing and prints a success message after the copy is complete.

This beginner-level Java project helps understand how to:

Work with byte streams for file I/O

Use try-with-resources for automatic resource management

Read from and write to files in Java

🎯 Aim
To copy the contents of a source file to a destination file using byte streams in Java.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Language: Java

IDE: Eclipse, VS Code, or command line

JDK: Java SE 21 (or compatible version)

🧠 Key Concepts Applied

FileInputStream & FileOutputStream

Byte stream handling

Exception handling

Try-with-resources

📄 Example Output

File copied successfully from input.txt to output.txt
