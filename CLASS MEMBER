•AIM
            To define a class Member with attributes member Id and member Name, and to implement a constructor and a method to display member details using object-oriented programming concepts in Java.                                                         
•ALGORITHM
    1.Start the program.
    2.Define a class Member with two attributes: memberId and memberName.
    3. Create a constructor to initialize these attributes.
    4.Define a method displayInfo() to print the member details.
    5.In the main() method, create an object of the class and call displayInfo().
•JAVA CODE
package assign;
public class Member {
    private int memberId;
    private String memberName;
public Member(int memberId, String memberName) {
        this.memberId = memberId;
        this.memberName = memberName;
    }
public void displayInfo() {
       System.out.println("Member ID: " + memberId);
        System.out.println("Member Name: " + memberName);
    }
public static void main(String[] args) {
        Member member1 = new Member(101, "Alice Johnson");
        member1.displayInfo();
    }
}
•OUTPUT
Member ID: 101
Member Name: Alice Johnson
